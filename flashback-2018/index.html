          <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>, Typical end of the year post as you may expect.</p>
<p>Well, 2018 was a significantly productive year for me compared to other years, learned so many things which I wanted to, plus added more things to the bucket list for the coming year. And you know what I am only going to talk about those in this post.</p>
<p>Let me draw a timeline of the events happened this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>January</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Installed <strong>Gentoo</strong>, finally, something I wanted to do after installing Arch but never got the confidence.</li>
<li>Started out <a href="https://github.com/hellozee/cook">cook</a>, a build system for me cause I could not get CMake.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>February</strong> :
<ul>
<li>My first open source contribution, a small <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D10202">patch</a> for Krita.</li>
<li>Was working on another patch, sadly never completed it, hush.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>March</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Another open source contribution this time for <a href="https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/merge_requests/214/diffs?commit_id=d245ec39ef11b6836fc0f8e8ce98222954344a05">Inkscape</a>, ohh yeahh.</li>
<li>Took a session on Portage Package Manager in IIITD, first technical speaking experience, was tough, missed many points, no one cares now. üòõ</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Jam, how can I miss it, the first time I tried my hands on any single board computer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>April</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Attended my first hackathon, fortunately, we never made past the initial pitch.</li>
<li>Can use cook for my projects, my first project which made it to the usable stage.</li>
<li>Installed <strong>LFS</strong>, you read that right, Linux From Scratch, though didn't use it for more than a week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>May</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Started working on <a href="https://github.com/eyeon/Fixture">fixture</a>, got tired of running a virtual machine for Photoshop.</li>
<li>An attempt to automate drawing posters for ILUGD, <a href="https://github.com/eyeon/Fixture">splatter</a>, sadly, now when I think of it, I don't remember the last time I worked on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>June</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Got my domain, set up my mail, all the credit goes to Github to offer me those.</li>
<li>Wrote a Lua script for doing the marvel intro in BlackMagic Design Fusion, something which opened a brand new domain for exploring to me.</li>
<li>Redid my website and set up the current blog using hugo.</li>
<li>My first patch for the flag module of Golang got merged, was only a doc patch nevertheless.</li>
<li>Started working on a rasterizer, <a href="https://github.com/hellozee/fragment">fragment</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>July</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Was working on fixture, apart from that, Qt Forums was quite nicer than StackOverflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>August</strong> :
<ul>
<li>As always I added another project, this time it was a ray tracer, <a href="https://github.com/hellozee/coo">coo</a>, but recently I just dumped it and archived the repo, writing a ray tracer in c was not my cup of tea.</li>
<li>Started learning CMake, finally, that scripting language is pretty ugly, but well CMake made my life a lot easier than thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>September</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Round Robin-ing my projects, academics suck, such a lame month, I had.</li>
<li>One year at India Linux Users Group - Delhi, wow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>October</strong> :
<ul>
<li>PyCon India, my first ever conference, which I attended as a volunteer, hesitated at first, but, now I am not going to miss any conference which I can afford to go.</li>
<li>That feeling when you sculpt someone else's project, like your own, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/farhaanbukhsh/file-indexer">dexer</a>.</li>
<li>Mozilla, here comes my first <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sops/pull/387">patch</a> for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>November</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Multiple docs patches into Golang, which are, ermm, still not accepted, looks like my Pull Requests got lost in the heap, hope someone merges them.</li>
<li>Tired of c, decided to write another ray tracer using c++ now, <a href="https://github.com/hellozee/frey">frey</a>, unfinished, but has tests and docs, what more does someone want, üòù</li>
<li>Bought a Raspberry Pi, yeah, finally, saved enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>December</strong> :
<ul>
<li>Redid that marvel script for Nuke, this time in Python, with more features.</li>
<li>Built my own image for the Raspberry Pi, thanks to BuildRoot to make this as easy as shopping on amazon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h3>
<ul>
<li>College sucks, the month which was the most productive had zero days of college.</li>
<li>I have a lot of unfinished projects which I need to finish quickly before starting any more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-did-i-learn">What did I learn?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can take a wild guess at the dimensions of Linux.</li>
<li>Test-driven development is a nice approach, which prevents a lot of headaches.</li>
<li>Interact more, unless you interact, you will be as idiot as you were yesterday.</li>
<li>Pulling stunts is necessary, only after coming down, I realized what I did inside Adobe.*</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="only-people-who-know-me-will-get-this-">*Only people who know me, will get this, üòâ</h5>
<h3 id="the-list-">The List üòÜ</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete both the rasterizer and the ray tracer.</li>
<li>Learn Nuke, more aptly its Python API.</li>
<li>Save enough for a 7&rdquo; touchscreen for Pi.</li>
<li>Do more patches for upstream projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, <code>:wq</code> for now.</p>
