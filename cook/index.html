          <p>Frankly speaking Computer Graphics is a subject which is not appreciated by most of students who study Computer Science just like Real Analysis in Mathematics but being a nerd, this were the perfect subjects which could act like stimulant for my neurons.</p>

<p>It has been about a year that I was trying to understand it, shaders, pipelines, gimbal lock, well I finally made it around New Year&rsquo;s Eve last year (don&rsquo;t judge me now, I am not that friendly anyway). At last I could write a piece of code which could display a cube and be modular at the same time, it was hard to understand OpenGL with concepts of Computer Graphics for the first time.</p>

<p>Wonderful, that does sound like a happy time but wait as the size of my code grew overtime, it became quite irritating to wait for the program to build for the slightest of change I make to a single file. Well the answer was simple, use a Makefile generator like CMake which had plugins to take care of stuff like that and reduce the build times.</p>

<p>While I started learning, how to write CMake scripts, from somewhere a thought poked my mind that I should write my own build system, using CMake will be overkill for such thing and immediately my guts be like &ldquo;Do it you idiot, you may learn something&rdquo;. Enough for motivating me, ðŸ˜„ .</p>

<p>So what should I have done?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learn how to write CMake scripts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I did?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Decided to write a build system of my own for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fast forward a month, I had a workable prototype ready, which was well, pretty damn slow. It was so slow that I could type the entire command needed to compile my program and compile while my build system was still busy, couple that up with a poorly written parser, it was not something I was proud of.</p>

<p>It was only after the next 2 months that I could use it, it was fast enough for me, it could have been more faster given that <code>go</code> has concurrency inbuilt but for now it was adequate for the size of the programs, I wrote.</p>

<p>What I learned from it?</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a Lexer?</li>
<li>What is a Parser?</li>
<li>About different hashing algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>More than that, to write the lexer/parser stuff I dived into go&rsquo;s source code, learning more about the language itself. Even though the lexer was nicer than I thought, the parser is a little rough (still going through the dragon book, ðŸ˜›) and there is neither any concurrency nor any import feature but fear not I am working on it.
