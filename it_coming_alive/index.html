<p>After digging for around a month and a half, I can finally do some selections with the Magnetic Lasso tool, which I wrote with utter laziness as I would say. Though it still demands a lot of work to be done, so it will be just polishing the existing code into perfection for the next one and half month.</p>

<h3 id="what-did-i-do">What did I do?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Implemented a checkpoint based edge calculation, obviously if you know the edge points from A to B and you need to find out the edge points between A to C, you don&rsquo;t need to recalculate the whole thing, saving a lot of computation.</li>
<li>Filtering and copying happens while initializing, so the tool would definitely be slow to start on bigger canvases, but once that is done, there is no such drop in performance.</li>
<li>And yes, we can complete the selection by clicking on the starting point and use them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-left-to-be-done">What is left to be done?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Paint the checkpoints while making the selection, honestly I already tried to do it, probably missed something.</li>
<li>Delete checkpoints on right click, this also seems trivial to implement, but yet to try, so no idea what kind of challenge it would be.</li>
<li>Working on the algorithm, one thing I notice was the accuracy got down as soon as I started copying the stuff, need to take a look at it.</li>
<li>An options dialog to mess with the parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p>And as boud says, I got to add some spaces to the code. üòÜ</p>

<p>That should be enough for the week, <code>:wq</code> for now.</p>
