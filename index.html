					Hi,<br>
					I am Kuntal, freshman at Delhi University, will be majoring in Computer Science,
					love working with statically typed languages, currently taking my time to understand 
					how light bounces off the surface.
					<br>
					My skills, though not so sharp as a professional but can handle quite a few problems,
					thanks to the experience of using Linux as my primary driver for the last 4 years. Also recently 
					I picked up docker as part of extending my reach to various container technologies. When it comes 
					to converse with computers, I primarily did that with C++ , but lately, I added Golang to my arsenal,
					you can find what kind of interesting conversations I had with it and the former one in my github repository.
					Pricking into my qualities, I do pick up things quickly.
