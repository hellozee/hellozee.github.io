				Hi,<br>
				I am Kuntal, freshman at Delhi University, will be majoring in Computer Science,<br>
				love working with statically typed languages, currently taking my time to understand <br>
				how light bounces off the surface.<br>
				<br><br>
				My skills though not so sharp as a professional but can handle quite a few problems,<br>
				thanks to the experience of using Linux as my primary driver for the last 4 years. Also recently <br>
				I picked up docker as part of extending my reach to various container technologies. When it comes <br>
				to converse with computers, I primarily did that with C++ , but lately, I added Golang to my arsenal,<br>
				you can find what kind of interesting conversations I had with it and the former one in my github repository.<br>
				Pricking into my qualities, I do pick up things quickly.<br>
