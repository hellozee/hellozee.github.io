      <description>October has been really great for me this year. It started with the Ada Lovelace Day meetup, or better, the after meetup party. The following week, my 6 months of effort got merged to master.</description>

      <description>So my mid semester break begins next week, finally I can take sometime off my academics and get some shit done.
To start off the weekend, I started working on the Magnetic Lasso again, it is almost complete, there are still some UX issues remaining, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it won&amp;rsquo;t take much time, considering that most of the work is done.</description>
