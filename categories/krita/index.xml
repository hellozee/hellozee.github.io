      <description>Honestly, working on correcting the checkpoint procedure made the tool explode. So I decided to take a couple of steps back and rethink the strategy. And for inspiration, I fired up YouTube and started watching tutorials of Photoshop&amp;rsquo;s Magnetic Lasso, cause that was the one which made me write this thing in the first place.</description>

      <description>After digging for around a month and a half, I can finally do some selections with the Magnetic Lasso tool, which I wrote with utter laziness as I would say.</description>

      <description>Finally, I can write myself as a professional developer, cause for the first time I got paid, that also by cash, for writing code. So after the boost battle of last month, it was time to test the algorithm out in the wild and not limit it to the confined boundary of the tests.</description>

      <description>Finally done with the first phase of the feature I wanted, 4 years back. Though just the unit test for the algorithm is implemented. At least for now, we can detect edges and stick to it.</description>

      <description>This would start with a quote:
 Documentation is like sex: when it is good, it is very, very good; and when it is bad, it is better than nothing.</description>

      <title>Another Week with boost::graph</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;prelude&amp;gt;
In the previous post, I discussed boost::astar_search and ignored the most important part of the whole setup, the graph itself. This I would say is a little harder to comprehend than boost::astar_search.</description>

      <description>Right now, I am having a hard time understanding BGL&amp;rsquo;s (the Boost Graph Library) template spaghetti, so decided to write a blogpost while I decipher it, one at a time, documenting the whole thing along the way.</description>

      <description>Note: Not a Game of Thrones fan, yet to watch even a single episode, but I wanted a catchy title
 This will be a story, so get prepared to be bored, ðŸ˜¸.</description>
