          <p>It has been more than a year that I had push rights for all the KDE repositories. So this is an obligatory anniversary post.</p>
<p>I got introduced to Linux while searching for development environments that came with all sorts of compilers &amp; interpreters by default and I don&rsquo;t have to manually install those stuff. It was 2012 as far as I remember, Ubuntu 12.04 just came out and it was the first solution suggested by the search engines. Though the unavailability of a proper internet connection meant, that I had to wait a couple more years when one of my friends downloaded a copy of Ubuntu 14.04 for me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all and nice, but where does KDE come into the picture? After trying out Ubuntu 14.04, I decided to give Kubuntu 14.04 a try and honestly I didn&rsquo;t like it. I did give plasma another try when I started using CentOS, as it was the recommended distro for using Autodesk&rsquo;s and The Foundry&rsquo;s tools, though GPU woes sent me back to Ubuntu.</p>
<p>How I got introduced to Krita, I don&rsquo;t know but what I liked about it was the striking similarity of it with Photoshop UI. Though later I was disappointed a bit since one of my favorite tools aka the Magnetic Lasso wasn&rsquo;t in there but GIMP had one. I did ask about it in the <a href="https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=156&amp;t=126095#p333692">forum</a>, probably the first feature request I did for any program.</p>
<p>After Krita&rsquo;s 4.0 release, I became interested in it again, why? Since right before that there was a Kickstarter that promised a better text tool with SVG support. Though I found it a bit disappointing. I mean come on, no on canvas editing? no control over kerning? why? who does that? That was the point where I decided, seems like they don&rsquo;t even care about the text tool, let&rsquo;s see how tough it is to fix it. And boy it is tough. I did get a <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/D10202">patch</a> to allow me to adjust the letter spacing, but Boud forgot to change the author while commiting and since I eventually gave up working on the other aspects of kerning, the branch was never merged and I vanished from the scene.</p>
<p>Three quarters of the year passed and owing to some <em>realisations</em>, I decided to start hacking back on Krita. But I was smarter this time, picked up a task marked as Junior Job worked on it. The task was supposed to be easy as remarked by Dmitry but ended up being not easy. I had to do multiple patches for having the feature eventually merged.</p>
<p>Still, I am not sure, why I was given the <a href="https://twitter.com/hellozee54/status/1087052525532921856">push rights</a> after the first commit. The official article about this mentions at least 2 or 3 patches and the bar is even higher for a project like Krita. Consequently and surprisingly, I was invited to the <a href="https://www.hellozee.dev/krita_sprint_2019/">sprints</a>, wow, this is getting special now.</p>
<p>Though I wanted to work on the text tool I ended up working on the <a href="https://www.hellozee.dev/to_be_merged_in_master/">magnetic lasso</a>, last summer, given the fact I was new to the codebase and text tool was not a rookie&rsquo;s walk in a park. I am still figuring out how to <em>fix</em> the text tool, if you have something to share, do poke me <a href="https://github.com/hellozee/qt-libraqm-test">here</a>.</p>
<p>All of these but why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i just came across your blog articles about the upcoming magnetic lasso tool in krita. I can&rsquo;t tell you how much i look forward to use it. I&rsquo;m using krita for photo retouching and composing (switched to krita after a decade using gimp!).
So this is definatively a feature that will help me a lot!!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For such E-Mails which just make your day, :3</p>
<p>Also, the fact being a KDE dev helped me realize how slick Plasma is. And since I am a Unity fanboy, I adjusted Plasma to mock Unity desktop of Ubuntu. Have a look.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.hellozee.dev/img/plasma1.png" alt="">
Latte Panels with <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/1274975/">this</a> Global Menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.hellozee.dev/img/plasma2.png" alt="">
Disabled the window decorations on maximized by adding <code>BorderlessMaximizedWindows=true</code> under <code>[Windows]</code> in <code>~/.config/kwinrc</code> and added window buttons in the panel with <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/1272871/">this</a> plasmoid.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.hellozee.dev/img/plasma3.png" alt="">
Super awesome <a href="https://github.com/Zren/plasma-hud">plasma-hud</a> which is using rofi, would be cool if this feature can be added to krunner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.hellozee.dev/img/plasma4.png" alt="">
And of course the <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/1169537/">simple menu</a>, so elegant, I hope the menu can stick to edges in the future. I wonder if I can hack Simple-Menu to include a hud and of course position those categories in the bottom.</p>
<p><code>:wq</code> for now.</p>
