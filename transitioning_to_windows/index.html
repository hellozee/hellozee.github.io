          <p>So, recently I started using windows for work. Why? There are a couple of reasons, one that I needed to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B">MSVC</a>, that is the Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain and the other being, I wasn&rsquo;t quite comfortable to ifdef stuff for making it work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a> aka, the GNU counterpart of MSVC.</p>
<p>All in all, the change wasn&rsquo;t a cakewalk, a part of which I can attribute to the fact that Windows does a lot of stuff in its own way which is just the opposite of the POSIX way. Though it was much better than what I expected, thanks to some all-new developer tools introduced by Microsoft. For now, most of them are still in an early phase, there is a start at least.</p>
<p>Installing Windows was the same as every time, easy process but taking a lot of time. And as always the first thing one does after installing Windows is to get a new browser, which I too did but not like the previous times. Previously I use to download Chrome or Firefox, whichever I was using in Linux. This time I downloaded neither of them. Instead of downloading the other browsers, went online and updated the Edge browser, since the new Microsoft Edge uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)">Blink</a> browser engine, the same which is used by Chrome, Chromium, and a multitude of modern browsers. The UX has felt a bit better than the other Blink based browsers specifically the part where you can sort your downloads by type of the file downloaded.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.hellozee.dev/img/edge_download.png" alt="Download Page of Microsoft Edge"></p>
<p>Next stop, getting my development environment up and running. And similar to every other developer coming from a POSIX background, it is time to get a functional shell that aids instead of being a pain in the posterior. But before even getting a usable shell, we need a usable terminal emulator. And thanks to Microsoft, we have the Windows Terminal, miles ahead of the vanilla command prompt. Though, it is still far behind something like <a href="https://konsole.kde.org/">Konsole</a>, cause it sports the UX of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal">GNOME terminal</a>, sadly. I don&rsquo;t know what is problem in having a proper title bar in GUI applications these days.</p>
<p>Eclipsing that, we have a new problem, Windows doesn&rsquo;t have a <em>proper</em> Bash shell, what a bummer. Well, it comes with Powershell 6 preinstalled which is not bad, but just like the browser, it is a bit dated and needs to be manually updated to Powershell 7. Being open-source, as well as a part of the most popular desktop OS on the planet helped it a lot. While Powershell has a set of problems of its own, there are solutions that help to mend it to a place. The first one being, <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine">PSReadLine</a>, and with the following commands, it feels more like home.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span class="nb">Set-PSReadLineOption</span> <span class="n">-EditMode</span> <span class="n">Emacs</span>
<span class="nb">Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler</span> <span class="n">-Key</span> <span class="n">Tab</span> <span class="n">-Function</span> <span class="n">Complete</span>
</code></pre></div><p>One of them gets the shortcuts like <code>Ctrl + a</code>, <code>Ctrl + e</code>, <code>Ctrl + w</code>, and the other makes the tab autocomplete function like the one in Bash. Woohoo, but wait what is the use of the terminal here in windows? We don&rsquo;t get any package manager or git here. Actually, we do, Microsoft has been working on a new package manager called <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli">winget</a> which looks like a ripoff of <a href="https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/">appget</a>, fortunately, we can talk about how Microsoft is screwing open source projects in some other posts but not today.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is still early considering it was announced just a few weeks back so I instead used <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolately</a>, a pretty solid package manager for Windows. And just like the Linux package managers, it needs administrative privileges to performs actions but Windows doesn&rsquo;t have <code>sudo</code>. So the first step was to install <a href="https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo">gsudo</a>, followed by <code>git</code>.</p>
<p>We have <code>git</code> now, * me plays the victory music *. Time to pimp the shell to the extreme. For assistance, we need a couple more modules, one is <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git</a> and the other being <a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">oh-my-posh</a>. The first module enables tab completion for <code>git</code> and also, adds some info regarding the repository in the prompt and another is just the Powershell counterpart of <code>oh-my-zsh</code>.</p>
<p>Also coming from plasma and being a fan of the Breeze color scheme, I downloaded the same from <a href="https://atomcorp.github.io/themes/">here</a>. Boom, the terminal looks like this now, slick isn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.hellozee.dev/img/windows_terminal.png" alt="Windows Terminal"></p>
<p>And here is my complete profile, a small one for now,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span class="nb">Import-Module</span> <span class="n">posh-git</span>
<span class="nb">Import-Module</span> <span class="n">oh-my-posh</span>

<span class="nb">Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler</span> <span class="n">-Key</span> <span class="n">Tab</span> <span class="n">-Function</span> <span class="n">Complete</span>
</code></pre></div><h6 id="note-avit-is-the-oh-my-posh-theme">Note: Avit is the <code>oh-my-posh</code> theme.</h6>
<p>Oh, I also started playing with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">PowerToys</a> which includes a lot of power utilities for Windows but just like other stuff, it is still beta-quality substance, although promising.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today, see yall later, <code>:wq</code>. And FYI, I have installed vim in windows too, didn&rsquo;t pimp it to an extreme yet for now.</p>
