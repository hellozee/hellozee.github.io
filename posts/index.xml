      <title>Another Week with boost::graph</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;prelude&amp;gt;
In the previous post, I discussed boost::astar_search and ignored the most important part of the whole setup, the graph itself. This I would say is a little harder to comprehend than boost::astar_search.</description>

      <description>Right now, I am having a hard time understanding BGL&amp;rsquo;s (the Boost Graph Library) template spaghetti, so decided to write a blogpost while I decipher it, one at a time, documenting the whole thing along the way.</description>

      <description>The title is a running joke now, please don&amp;rsquo;t hit me, I know that this is one hell of an aloof conclusion. But why? Let&amp;rsquo;s retrospect the situation.
 Linux is just the kernel Add a display server on top of it Add a window manager Add a compositor Add a display manager  You will get a desktop, yes a desktop and not a desktop environment.</description>

      <description>I never expected such a dreadful day would come such that I have to install Windows, cause I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough money. And yes, you read it right, nothing is wrong in the previous statement.</description>

      <title>How Design Works?</title>

      <guid>https://hellozee.github.io/posts/how-design-works/</guid>
      <description>Note: The title may be misleading, ðŸ˜›
 I started dabbling with graphic design back when I was in 7th grade, that time I saw someone working in Photoshop, probably was extracting a person and putting that extracted piece on top another picture, the wow moment that was and I be like I also want to do that, so got a copy of Adobe Photoshop 7, technically a pirated copy but well, Photoshop 7 was not being sold anymore back then and I was just experimenting with it, so ethically I was like, okay, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt anyone, let that be so.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Youtube&amp;rdquo;-ing seems like a trendy hobby for most of the people of my age, vlogs seem to be taking over blogs but I don&amp;rsquo;t have the required setup to record videos nor the time to invest in making videos.</description>

      <description>Speaking from a normal person&amp;rsquo;s point of view, do praises hurt? or if I can phrase it better, what hurts more, praise or criticism? An appropriate answer would be none, if you can take praise with your head held high you must be able to take criticism with the same attitude, right?</description>

      <description>The story begins in PyCon India 2018, I, with a tired soul (registration desk is not a quite nice place for resting), shivering in freezing cold, after a dosage of Paracetamol, asked fhackdroid to tell me about any project which uses Go, so that I can also put some patches during devsprint.</description>

      <description>If you don&amp;rsquo;t get the meme reference from the title, here is one more for you :

      <description>tl;dr, Typical end of the year post as you may expect.
Well, 2018 was a significantly productive year for me compared to other years, learned so many things which I wanted to, plus added more things to the bucket list for the coming year.</description>

      <description>If you search the web for how to learn something, you will surely get a bunch of techniques that would help you to remember something but that is not the learning I am talking about, that is in a sense, a kind of memorization.</description>

      <description>So apparently one of the oldest community in probably the whole India, celebrated its 2nd anniversary on 28th after it was revived back on 2016. And you know what, this time it was a Capture The Flag event, something new tried by the new group of people who joined hands to not let this community go in hibernation again.</description>

      <description>ILUGD better known as India Linux Users Group - Delhi, a LUG, based in Delhi NCR. Bear in mind that it is &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;Indian&amp;rdquo;, a lot of people get that incorrect, &amp;ldquo;Indian&amp;rdquo; means it is exclusively for Indians which we are obviously not, but our group is based in Delhi which comes in India so, hashtag_blah_blah.</description>

      <description>Frankly speaking Computer Graphics is a subject which is not appreciated by most of students who study Computer Science just like Real Analysis in Mathematics but being a nerd, this were the perfect subjects which could act like stimulant for my neurons.</description>
