      <description>I never expected such a dreadful day would come such that I have to install Windows, cause I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough money. And yes, you read it right, nothing is wrong in the previous statement.</description>

      <description>ILUGD better known as India Linux Users Group - Delhi, a LUG, based in Delhi NCR. Bear in mind that it is &amp;ldquo;India&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;Indian&amp;rdquo;, a lot of people get that incorrect, &amp;ldquo;Indian&amp;rdquo; means it is exclusively for Indians which we are obviously not, but our group is based in Delhi which comes in India so, hashtag_blah_blah.</description>
