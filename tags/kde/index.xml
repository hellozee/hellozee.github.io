      <description>The title is a running joke now, please don&amp;rsquo;t hit me, I know that this is one hell of an aloof conclusion. But why? Let&amp;rsquo;s retrospect the situation.
 Linux is just the kernel Add a display server on top of it Add a window manager Add a compositor Add a display manager  You will get a desktop, yes a desktop and not a desktop environment.</description>

      <description>Note: Not a Game of Thrones fan, yet to watch even a single episode, but I wanted a catchy title

      <description>Note: The title may be misleading, ðŸ˜›
 I started dabbling with graphic design back when I was in 7th grade, that time I saw someone working in Photoshop, probably was extracting a person and putting that extracted piece on top another picture, the wow moment that was and I be like I also want to do that, so got a copy of Adobe Photoshop 7, technically a pirated copy but well, Photoshop 7 was not being sold anymore back then and I was just experimenting with it, so ethically I was like, okay, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt anyone, let that be so.</description>
