      <description>My exams are over and hopefully I would back in for doing weeklies again, unless there is an Internet Shutdown in my area. Anyway, looking at the bug count we have 432 bugs open, 3 more bugs than what I reported in the last weekly.</description>

      <description>We had a release last week and boy, I would just skip talking about bugs for this one. But we currently have 429 open bugs, 14 more from what I reported last week.</description>

      <description>This week we got 13 new bug reports while 22 got fixed, a net decrease of 9 bugs. The bug tracker says that there are about 415 bugs remaining, so still a long way to go.</description>

      <description>The number of bug reports have rose from 18 to 33 this week, out if which my magnetic lasso is guilty of a couple. I promise I will take care of them as soon as I get rid of the university exams which are coming up.</description>

      <description>This week in Krita has been more around features, rather than bug fixing. We had around 18 bug reports but at the same time 18 bugs were fixed too.
We can now import jpeg2000 files into Krita.</description>

      <description>Preface Okay, so recently one of Boud&#39;s posts sparked some conversations in hackernews and reddit. So this is my part of taking care of a couple of the points raised in those discussions.</description>

      <title>One hell of a October</title>

      <description>October has been really great for me this year. It started with the Ada Lovelace Day meetup, or better, the after meetup party. The following week, my 6 months of effort got merged to master.</description>

      <description>So, finally it seems like, after crossing the deadline by a couple months, Magnetic Lasso is going to get merged, as Boud told me. Lets see how many more weeks it takes, so presumably it is complete feature wise but who knows from where a bug might pop up.</description>

      <description>So my mid semester break begins next week, finally I can take sometime off my academics and get some shit done.
To start off the weekend, I started working on the Magnetic Lasso again, it is almost complete, there are still some UX issues remaining, but I don&#39;t think it won&#39;t take much time, considering that most of the work is done.</description>

      <description>Three months of fighting with boost, qt, having a proper plan, multiple individuals to get help from and still unable to hit the target in time. That will be software engineering 101 for me.</description>

      <description>I won&#39;t say that I am done with Magnetic Lasso now, but the results are a lot better now to be honest. Take a look at one of the tests that I did,</description>

      <description>The sprint has officially ended yesterday and most of the participants have already left, except me, Ivan, Wolthera and Jouni. Well I would have also left as planned but I read my flight timings wrong and it would leave after 3 hours of what I thought the departure time was.</description>

      <description>Well, I did manage to get some work done during the start of the week cause after that it was just dripping nose and back to back headaches along with a sore throat for around the next 3 days, and I also had to prepare for Krita sprints happening next week.</description>

      <title>Somewhat Usable</title>

      <description>Adding a feature by yourself is a lot satisfying than requesting someone to add that for you, cause now you are both the producer and the consumer. But to be honest, I never thought I would be the one implementing the Magnetic Lasso for Krita when I requested it 4 years back, leave the fact that I even getting paid for doing so.</description>

      <description>Honestly, working on correcting the checkpoint procedure made the tool explode. So I decided to take a couple of steps back and rethink the strategy. And for inspiration, I fired up YouTube and started watching tutorials of Photoshop&#39;s Magnetic Lasso, cause that was the one which made me write this thing in the first place.</description>

      <description>After digging for around a month and a half, I can finally do some selections with the Magnetic Lasso tool, which I wrote with utter laziness as I would say. Though it still demands a lot of work to be done, so it will be just polishing the existing code into perfection for the next one and half month.</description>

      <description>Finally, I can write myself as a professional developer, cause for the first time I got paid, that also by cash, for writing code. So after the boost battle of last month, it was time to test the algorithm out in the wild and not limit it to the confined boundary of the tests.</description>

      <description>Finally done with the first phase of the feature I wanted, 4 years back. Though just the unit test for the algorithm is implemented. At least for now, we can detect edges and stick to it.</description>

      <title>Another Week with boost::graph</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;prelude&amp;gt;
In the previous post, I discussed boost::astar_search and ignored the most important part of the whole setup, the graph itself. This I would say is a little harder to comprehend than boost::astar_search.</description>

      <description>Right now, I am having a hard time understanding BGL&#39;s (the Boost Graph Library) template spaghetti, so decided to write a blogpost while I decipher it, one at a time, documenting the whole thing along the way.</description>

      <title>How Design Works?</title>
      <link>https://www.hellozee.dev/how-design-works/</link>

      <guid>https://www.hellozee.dev/how-design-works/</guid>
      <description>Note: The title may be misleading, ðŸ˜›
 I started dabbling with graphic design back when I was in 7th grade, that time I saw someone working in Photoshop, probably was extracting a person and putting that extracted piece on top another picture, the wow moment that was and I be like I also want to do that, so got a copy of Adobe Photoshop 7, technically a pirated copy but well, Photoshop 7 was not being sold anymore back then and I was just experimenting with it, so ethically I was like, okay, it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone, let that be so.</description>
